# Overview
This repository focuses on the direct use of syscalls to carry out attacks within the application, while the other repositories in this project focus on the use of direct/indirect syscalls, but search for SSNs dynamically.

# Usage 

You can run with cargo run or the compiled binary directly:
```sh
cargo run
```
```sh
target/release/syscalls.exe
```
